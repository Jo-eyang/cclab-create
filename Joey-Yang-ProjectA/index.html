               This project is simulating a part of the immune system in your body. You are playing as a white blood cell. Follow the instructions on the screen, and try to protect the other cells in your body.

            
            </p>
            <p>
                You can change different states of this body environment, in this case generating different forms of the virus.

            In modern society, the epidemic is a keyword. It seems that the faster the world develops, the more viruses are to be born. From a scientist's point of view, I prefer to create more advanced immune cells that act as "defenders" in the body, efficiently destroying different forms of viruses, and healing infected cells. The project encourages people to experience dealing with disease themselves in a simulated physical environment.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            The main purpose of this project is to allow people to play a white blood cell in a simulated physical environment. You can look at what types of changes occur to one of your body's cells when it is threatened, and discover what you as an immune cell can do in the process. On the other hand, you can also change the internal environment of the body through interaction, in which case the form of the virus changes to adapt to the different internal environment.
