                Tim Berners-Lee envisions a future web characterized by open and decentralized principles, emphasizing user control over their own data, privacy protection, and an inclusive, accessible digital environment. While some of these elements have been embraced and reinforced, such as the ongoing development of privacy regulations and the proliferation of open-source projects, the web's landscape has also seen significant challenges.

                Additionally, issues like misinformation and online privacy violations remain challenges in achieving Berners-Lee's vision. He wanted the web to be a place where people could find true and reliable information easily. Fake news goes against this because it's false information that can trick people. To make the web more like the author's vision, we need to find ways to stop fake news and help people know what's true and what's not. That means teaching people how to tell the difference and making sure the information on the web is trustworthy.
